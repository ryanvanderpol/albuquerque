Albuquerque
=========

A simple, A/B testing framework for Express.js. ABQ is middleware that sits between your users and the Express.js rendering engine and doesnâ€™t require you to change any of your existing code.

ABQ randomly assigns a user to either Set A or Set B and automatically swaps out any view with an available A/B view, falling back to the default view if an A/B view does not exist.  

You can use this to test the effectiveness of one view to another.

## Installation

``` shell
  npm install albuquerque --save
```

## Usage

ABQ is Express.js middleware and can be setup really simply.

``` js
var abq = require('albuquerque');
app.use(abq());
```

## Templates

ABQ overrides the express rendering engine and looks for your A/B views in `{view path}/_a/` and `{view path}/_b/`. You can override this by passing in your own roots paths.

``` js
app.use(abq({ viewRootA: 'test-views/a', viewRootB: 'test-views/b' }));
```

## Session

ABQ randomly assigns a user to either the A or B set and uses session state to store the assignment.  Make sure you initialize ABQ after your session provider.

``` js
var abq = require('albuquerque');

app.use(session({ secret: 'hiesenberg' }));
app.use(abq());
```

In your own code, you can always find out what set the user is in.

``` js

if(req.session.albuquerque.set === 'A'){
    console.log('This user is an A!');
}

```
